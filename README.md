# ComfyUI Discomfort Extension

A ComfyUI extension that enables **loop-based workflow execution** with dynamic data flow between iterations. Originally conceived for batch image processing, Discomfort has evolved to support dependent iterative workflows where outputs from iteration N feed into iteration N+1.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status: Core Functionality Broken

**IMPORTANT**: The core `run_sequential()` functionality is currently **NOT WORKING**. While the individual components are implemented, the data injection mechanism that enables loop execution is failing. See the "Current Issues" section below for details.

### What IS Working ‚úÖ
- **DiscomfortPort nodes**: Individual nodes function correctly in ComfyUI workflows
- **Port discovery**: `discover_ports()` successfully analyzes workflows and identifies DiscomfortPorts
- **Workflow stitching**: `stitch_workflows()` can merge multiple workflow JSONs
- **Serialization**: `serialize()/deserialize()` handles data persistence across iterations
- **Supporting nodes**: DiscomfortFolderImageLoader and DiscomfortImageDescriber work independently
- **Basic testing**: Test scripts can run and validate individual components

### What is NOT Working ‚ùå
- **`run_sequential()` method**: The core loop execution functionality is broken
- **Data injection**: Cannot inject data into INPUT ports during workflow execution
- **Loop execution**: Cannot run workflows in sequence with state preservation
- **Cross-iteration data flow**: Outputs from one iteration cannot feed into the next

## üéØ Core Concept

ComfyUI's native execution model follows a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) pattern, executing nodes once in topological order. While powerful for single-pass workflows, this model doesn't natively support:
- Iterative refinement workflows
- Conditional execution paths  
- State preservation across iterations
- Dynamic workflow composition

Discomfort addresses these limitations by introducing a loop-enabled execution layer on top of ComfyUI's DAG model.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Key Components

#### 1. DiscomfortPort (The Foundation)
DiscomfortPort is the cornerstone node that enables dynamic I/O injection and extraction. It operates in three modes, automatically determined by its connections:

- **INPUT mode**: No incoming connections - serves as an injection point
- **OUTPUT mode**: No outgoing connections - serves as an extraction point  
- **PASSTHRU mode**: Both incoming and outgoing connections - passes data through, exposing it only if no matching OUTPUT exists

#### 2. DiscomfortWorkflowTools (The Engine)
This utility class provides the core functionality:

- **discover_ports()**: Analyzes workflows to identify DiscomfortPorts, infer their types, and compute execution order ‚úÖ
- **stitch_workflows()**: Merges multiple workflow JSONs by renumbering nodes/links and creating cross-workflow connections ‚úÖ
- **run_sequential()**: Executes workflows in a loop with state preservation ‚ùå **BROKEN**
- **serialize()/deserialize()**: Handles data persistence across iterations ‚úÖ

#### 3. Supporting Nodes
- **DiscomfortFolderImageLoader**: Loads images from folders as batched tensors ‚úÖ
- **DiscomfortImageDescriber**: Generates AI descriptions via OpenAI-compatible APIs ‚úÖ
- **DiscomfortLoopExecutor**: (Planned) User-facing node for configuring loop execution

## üö® Current Issues

### The Core Problem: Data Injection Failure

The `run_sequential()` method is failing at the data injection step. While we have switched our implementation to pre-editing the workflow json file in order to allow for data injection, our current still relies to some extent on monkey-patching ComfyUI to accept the data injection. We try this by way of:

1. Injecting validation placeholders into the prompt
2. Having DiscomfortPort nodes retrieve real data during execution

**Possible reasons why it's failing**:
- **Validation vs Execution Context**: ComfyUI validates the entire workflow before execution, but placeholders must satisfy type validation without having the actual data
- **Execution Isolation**: ComfyUI may run nodes in isolated contexts, making access to data in real-time difficult or impossible
- **Async Execution Model**: Data injection timing may be misaligned with ComfyUI's async execution model
- **Import Structure**: Namespace issues between modules could be preventing data access

See the section "CURRENT TASK: MAJOR REFACTORING OF RUN_SEQUENTIAL" below for our plan of attack to address these issues.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone this repository into your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory:
```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/fidecastro/comfyui-discomfort.git discomfort
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd discomfort
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Restart ComfyUI

## üìñ Usage

### What You Can Do Now

1. **Individual DiscomfortPort nodes**: Add them to workflows and use them for data passing within a single execution
2. **Port discovery**: Use `discover_ports()` to analyze workflows
3. **Workflow stitching**: Use `stitch_workflows()` to merge multiple workflow JSONs
4. **Supporting nodes**: Use DiscomfortFolderImageLoader and DiscomfortImageDescriber independently

### What You Cannot Do Yet

- **Loop execution**: The `run_sequential()` method is broken
- **Cross-iteration data flow**: Cannot pass outputs from one iteration to the next
- **Iterative workflows**: Cannot run workflows multiple times with state preservation

### Example (What Works)

```python
from custom_nodes.discomfort.workflow_tools import DiscomfortWorkflowTools

tools = DiscomfortWorkflowTools()

# This works - discover ports in a workflow
ports = tools.discover_ports("workflow.json")
print(f"Found {len(ports)} DiscomfortPorts")

# This works - stitch multiple workflows
merged = tools.stitch_workflows(["workflow1.json", "workflow2.json"])

# This DOES NOT WORK - loop execution is broken
# result = await tools.run_sequential(
#     workflow_paths=["workflow.json"],
#     inputs={"input_data": your_data},
#     iterations=5,
#     use_ram=True
# )
```

### Serialization Strategy
Handles arbitrary ComfyUI data types using a unified format:
```json
{
  "type": "TORCH_TENSOR|STRING|JSON|CUSTOM|etc",
  "content": "serialized_data"
}
```

### Storage Strategy
- **In-RAM (Default)**: Fast, direct passing between iterations (preferred)
- **In-Disk (Fallback)**: For large objects or when RAM is limited

## üéØ Future Vision

Once the core execution mechanism is working, Discomfort may enable:
- **Iterative refinement pipelines**: Progressively improve outputs
- **Conditional workflows**: Branch execution based on intermediate results
- **State machines**: Complex multi-stage processing with memory
- **Dynamic workflow composition**: Build workflows programmatically
- **Batch processing**: As a special case of loops with independent iterations
- **Distributed Execution**: Support for multi-machine setups
- **Caching**: Smart caching of intermediate results
- **Visual Debugging**: UI tools to visualize data flow between iterations

# CURRENT TASK: MAJOR REFACTORING OF RUN_SEQUENTIAL

As stated before, Discomfort is supposed to be a ComfyUI extension designed to unlock the platform's full potential by enabling **stateful, iterative, and conditional workflow execution**. Discomfort should transform ComfyUI from a single-pass execution engine into a dynamic, general-purpose computation platform. This section addresses the major blocker to this task, which lies in the execution strategy underpinning the workflow processing.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status: Major Refactor in Progress

**IMPORTANT**: The core iterative functionality (`run_sequential()`) is currently **not working**. The initial implementation attempted to inject data into running workflows using methods that conflict with ComfyUI's core architecture, leading to validation failures and instability.

This discovery has led to a complete refactoring of the execution engine. This document outlines the new, robust architecture that will be implemented to deliver on the project's ambitious goals.

## üéØ The Vision: True Iteration in ComfyUI

ComfyUI's native Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) model is powerful but limited to a single pass. Discomfort's vision is to overcome this by enabling complex control flows, including:

  - **Iterative Refinement:** Feeding the output of a workflow back into its own input for progressive improvement.
  - **Stateful Chains:** Executing multiple different workflows in sequence, where the results of `Workflow A` become the inputs for `Workflow B`.
  - **Conditional Logic:** Using `IF/THEN/ELSE` branches and `DO/WHILE` loops to create dynamic, intelligent workflows that can make decisions based on their own output.
  - **Type-Agnostic Data Flow:** Passing any data type‚Äî`IMAGE`, `MODEL`, `LATENT`, `CONDITIONING`, or any custom type‚Äîbetween iterations seamlessly.

## üí° The Solution: Pre-Execution Graph Manipulation + Nesting of ComfyUI instances

Instead of fighting ComfyUI's architecture, the new solution embraces it. For each iteration of a loop, the Discomfort engine will **programmatically construct a new, completely valid workflow prompt** that is self-contained and ready for execution. This eliminates the validation and race condition issues of the previous approach.

This workflow should then be fed into a **nested ComfyUI server**, instantiated programmatically via the use of the ComfyConnector class available in the comfy_serverless module.

This is achieved with three key components:

### 1\. The `ComfyConnector` Class

ComfyConnector is a singleton class that acts as a Python wrapper to ComfyUI and allows us to pass workflows directly to its API. By choosing to nest a second ComfyUI server from within the runtime of ComfyUI, we liberate ourselves from the need to monkey patch the main ComfyUI instance in order to run a separate workflow, completely obviating our validation issues.

Nesting two ComfyUI servers will also future-proof the code since we all it will take to run the run_sequential method is to pre-edit the workflow.json script to add to it the DiscomfortDataLoader node on top of the INPUT DiscomfortPorts. As the workflow.json structure is pretty solid at this point in time in the ComfyUI repository, this should make our code much less fragile to future developments of ComfyUI.

ComfyConnector offers 3 methods that will be helpful:
    - `upload_data`, to add (via disk memory) any required data (images, models etc) to the nested ComfyUI for execution. To avoid memory bloating, uploads flagged as ephemeral are automatically deleted when the server is killed.
    - `run_workflow`, to queue the pre-edited workflow.json for execution on the nested ComfyUI, receiving its history object in the end (which should contain the outputs of the workflow run)
    - `kill_api`, to kill the nested ComfyUI server upon the end of the workflow run.

### 2\. The `DiscomfortLoopExecutor` Orchestrator

This will be the main user-facing node. It will manage the entire loop's state and logic, deciding whether to continue, break, or branch based on user-defined conditions. (More information on the vision for its functionalities are available in the documentation: discomfort_doc_DiscomfortLoopExecutor_high_level_logic.md.)

### 3\. Universal Data Loader: `DiscomfortDataLoader`

To pass data between iterations efficiently and reliably, Discomfort will strive to use a hybrid strategy:

  - **üöÄ In-Memory (Default):** For maximum speed, data objects are passed between iterations as direct Python references via a controlled in-memory store. This is our preferred method of passing data around, butg we might be limited to use this strategy without monkey-patching ComfyUI's runtime execution.
  - **üíæ On-Disk (Fallback):** We may store data objects on-disk, either to conform to vanilla ComfyUI runtime execution or to prevent out-of-memory errors.

An internal `DiscomfortDataLoader` node, which is invisible to the user, is then programmatically inserted into the workflow. This universal loader should be configured to fetch the correct data from either memory or disk as the case may be, ensuring the workflow is valid and has access to the required inputs before it even begins execution.

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works: An Iteration in Detail

1.  **Orchestration Begins:** The `DiscomfortLoopExecutor` node starts an iteration. It holds the current state of all loop variables (e.g., images, text, numbers) in a `loop_state` dictionary. It also instantiates a new ComfyConnector singleton, which triggers the launch of the nested ComfyUI server that will execute the workflow(s).
2.  **Data Preparation:** The orchestrator examines the data in `loop_state`. Based on size and user settings, it either places the data object into the in-memory `_DATA_STORE` or saves it to a temporary file on disk.
3.  **Graph Manipulation:** The orchestrator takes a fresh copy of the target workflow and manipulates it according to achieve the required logic imposed by the run. It finds the placeholder `DiscomfortPort (INPUT)` nodes and replaces them with the internal `DiscomfortDataLoader` node. This new loader is pre-configured with the key or file path to the data for this iteration.
4.  **Execution with nested ComfyUI server:** The modified workflow is now a standard, valid ComfyUI prompt. It is sent to the nested ComfyUI server via the ComfyConnector singleton, which validates and executes it without any special handling.
5.  **Output Extraction:** Once the workflow finishes, the orchestrator inspects the execution history and extracts the data from any `DiscomfortPort (OUTPUT)` nodes. The extracted data is used to update the `loop_state` dictionary. 
[If more than one workflow.json was set to be run by the user, then the orchestrator will move to the next workflow and execute steps (3-5) subsequently until the list of workflows is exhausted.]
6.  **Loop & Condition Check:** The orchestrator then evaluates the user-defined loop conditions to decide whether to start the next iteration, take a branch, or end the loop.

This cycle ensures every single execution is robust, efficient, and fully compliant with ComfyUI's architecture.

## üìñ Usage (Post-Refactor)

Once the refactor is complete, using Discomfort will be straightforward. You will use the `DiscomfortLoopExecutor` node to control your iterative workflows.

**Example: An Iterative Upscaling Workflow**

1.  **Create Workflows:**
      * `init.json`: A simple workflow with a `LoadImage` node connected to a `DiscomfortPort (OUTPUT)` with `unique_id` set to `current_image`.
      * `upscale_step.json`: A workflow that takes an image from a `DiscomfortPort (INPUT)` (`unique_id`: `current_image`), runs it through an upscaler, and outputs it to another `DiscomfortPort (OUTPUT)` (`unique_id`: `current_image`).
2.  **Configure the Loop:**
      * Add a `DiscomfortLoopExecutor` node to your graph.
      * Set **`workflow_paths`** to:
        ```
        init.json
        upscale_step.json
        ```
      * Set **`max_iterations`** to `3`.
      * Set **`loop_condition_expression`** to `discomfort_loop_counter <= max_iterations`. This will run the `upscale_step.json` workflow three times.

When you run this, Discomfort will execute `init.json` once, then loop through `upscale_step.json` three times, passing the upscaled image from each run back into the start of the next.

## üß™ Testing

The best testing environment is ComfyUI itself, with test nodes created for that purpose, that are run within the UI itself.
