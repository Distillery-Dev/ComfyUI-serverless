# ComfyUI Discomfort Extension

A ComfyUI extension that enables **loop-based workflow execution** with dynamic data flow between iterations. Originally conceived for batch image processing, Discomfort has evolved to support dependent iterative workflows where outputs from iteration N feed into iteration N+1.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status: Core Functionality Broken

**IMPORTANT**: The core `run_sequential()` functionality is currently **NOT WORKING**. While the individual components are implemented, the data injection mechanism that enables loop execution is failing. See the "Current Issues" section below for details.

### What IS Working ‚úÖ
- **DiscomfortPort nodes**: Individual nodes function correctly in ComfyUI workflows
- **Port discovery**: `discover_ports()` successfully analyzes workflows and identifies DiscomfortPorts
- **Workflow stitching**: `stitch_workflows()` can merge multiple workflow JSONs
- **Serialization**: `serialize()/deserialize()` handles data persistence across iterations
- **Supporting nodes**: DiscomfortFolderImageLoader and DiscomfortImageDescriber work independently
- **Basic testing**: Test scripts can run and validate individual components

### What is NOT Working ‚ùå
- **`run_sequential()` method**: The core loop execution functionality is broken
- **Data injection**: Cannot inject data into INPUT ports during workflow execution
- **Loop execution**: Cannot run workflows in sequence with state preservation
- **Cross-iteration data flow**: Outputs from one iteration cannot feed into the next

## üéØ Core Concept

ComfyUI's native execution model follows a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) pattern, executing nodes once in topological order. While powerful for single-pass workflows, this model doesn't natively support:
- Iterative refinement workflows
- Conditional execution paths  
- State preservation across iterations
- Dynamic workflow composition

Discomfort addresses these limitations by introducing a loop-enabled execution layer on top of ComfyUI's DAG model.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Key Components

#### 1. DiscomfortPort (The Foundation)
DiscomfortPort is the cornerstone node that enables dynamic I/O injection and extraction. It operates in three modes, automatically determined by its connections:

- **INPUT mode**: No incoming connections - serves as an injection point
- **OUTPUT mode**: No outgoing connections - serves as an extraction point  
- **PASSTHRU mode**: Both incoming and outgoing connections - passes data through, exposing it only if no matching OUTPUT exists

#### 2. DiscomfortWorkflowTools (The Engine)
This utility class provides the core functionality:

- **discover_ports()**: Analyzes workflows to identify DiscomfortPorts, infer their types, and compute execution order ‚úÖ
- **stitch_workflows()**: Merges multiple workflow JSONs by renumbering nodes/links and creating cross-workflow connections ‚úÖ
- **run_sequential()**: Executes workflows in a loop with state preservation ‚ùå **BROKEN**
- **serialize()/deserialize()**: Handles data persistence across iterations ‚úÖ

#### 3. Supporting Nodes
- **DiscomfortFolderImageLoader**: Loads images from folders as batched tensors ‚úÖ
- **DiscomfortImageDescriber**: Generates AI descriptions via OpenAI-compatible APIs ‚úÖ
- **DiscomfortLoopExecutor**: (Planned) User-facing node for configuring loop execution

## üö® Current Issues

### The Core Problem: Data Injection Failure

The `run_sequential()` method is failing at the data injection step. The mechanism attempts to:

1. Store actual data in `_temp_execution_data[execution_id][uid]`
2. Inject validation placeholders into the prompt
3. Have DiscomfortPort nodes retrieve real data during execution

**Why it's failing**:
- **Validation vs Execution Context**: ComfyUI validates the entire workflow before execution, but placeholders must satisfy type validation without having the actual data
- **Execution Isolation**: ComfyUI may run nodes in isolated contexts, making global variables like `_temp_execution_data` inaccessible
- **Async Execution Model**: Data injection timing may be misaligned with ComfyUI's async execution model
- **Import Structure**: Namespace issues between modules could be preventing data access

### Technical Challenges

1. **Validation Placeholders**: The current placeholder structure may not be properly formatted for ComfyUI's validator
2. **Global State Access**: The DiscomfortPort's `process_port` method may not be correctly looking up data from the global store
3. **Execution Timing**: The synchronous wait loop might be missing execution completion signals

See the section "CURRENT TASK: MAJOR REFACTORING OF RUN_SEQUENTIAL" below for our plan of attack to address these issues.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone this repository into your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory:
```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/fidecastro/comfyui-discomfort.git discomfort
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd discomfort
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Restart ComfyUI

## üìñ Usage

### What You Can Do Now

1. **Individual DiscomfortPort nodes**: Add them to workflows and use them for data passing within a single execution
2. **Port discovery**: Use `discover_ports()` to analyze workflows
3. **Workflow stitching**: Use `stitch_workflows()` to merge multiple workflow JSONs
4. **Supporting nodes**: Use DiscomfortFolderImageLoader and DiscomfortImageDescriber independently

### What You Cannot Do Yet

- **Loop execution**: The `run_sequential()` method is broken
- **Cross-iteration data flow**: Cannot pass outputs from one iteration to the next
- **Iterative workflows**: Cannot run workflows multiple times with state preservation

### Example (What Works)

```python
from custom_nodes.discomfort.workflow_tools import DiscomfortWorkflowTools

tools = DiscomfortWorkflowTools()

# This works - discover ports in a workflow
ports = tools.discover_ports("workflow.json")
print(f"Found {len(ports)} DiscomfortPorts")

# This works - stitch multiple workflows
merged = tools.stitch_workflows(["workflow1.json", "workflow2.json"])

# This DOES NOT WORK - loop execution is broken
# result = await tools.run_sequential(
#     workflow_paths=["workflow.json"],
#     inputs={"input_data": your_data},
#     iterations=5,
#     use_ram=True
# )
```

## üß™ Testing

See `TEST_README.md` for detailed testing instructions. Two test approaches are available:

1. **Module Test** (`test_discomfort.py`): Direct module testing ‚úÖ
2. **API Test** (`test_simple.py`): HTTP API-based testing ‚úÖ

**Note**: These tests validate individual components but cannot test the broken `run_sequential()` functionality.

## üîß Technical Details

### Serialization Strategy
Handles arbitrary ComfyUI data types using a unified format:
```json
{
  "type": "TORCH_TENSOR|STRING|JSON|CUSTOM|etc",
  "content": "serialized_data"
}
```

### Storage Strategy
- **In-RAM (Default)**: Fast, direct passing between iterations
- **In-Disk (Fallback)**: For large objects or when RAM is limited

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps to Fix

### 1. Revise Data Injection Mechanism
Instead of relying on global state and placeholders, consider:
- Using ComfyUI's built-in caching system (investigate `CacheSet` in execution.py)
- Implementing a custom execution context that ComfyUI recognizes
- Exploring ComfyUI's "hidden" inputs mechanism for data passing

### 2. Debug Current Implementation
Add extensive logging to trace:
- When data is stored in `_temp_execution_data`
- When DiscomfortPort attempts to retrieve it
- The exact validation errors being encountered
- The state of the execution context at each step

### 3. Alternative Approaches
Consider these architectural alternatives:
- **Workflow Preprocessing**: Modify the workflow JSON to embed data directly before execution
- **Custom Executor**: Extend ComfyUI's PromptExecutor rather than working around it
- **Node Chaining**: Use ComfyUI's native link system more directly, creating temporary nodes that hold data

### 4. Simplify Initial Implementation
Start with a minimal viable approach:
- Single iteration, single workflow
- Simple data types (just IMAGE or STRING)
- No conditional logic
- Extensive logging at every step

## üéØ Future Vision

Once the core execution mechanism is working, Discomfort will enable:
- **Iterative refinement pipelines**: Progressively improve outputs
- **Conditional workflows**: Branch execution based on intermediate results
- **State machines**: Complex multi-stage processing with memory
- **Dynamic workflow composition**: Build workflows programmatically
- **Batch processing**: As a special case of loops with independent iterations

# CURRENT TASK: MAJOR REFACTORING OF RUN_SEQUENTIAL

As stated before, Discomfort is supposed to be a ComfyUI extension designed to unlock the platform's full potential by enabling **stateful, iterative, and conditional workflow execution**. Discomfort should transform ComfyUI from a single-pass execution engine into a dynamic, general-purpose computation platform. This section addresses the major blocker to this task, which lies in the execution strategy underpinning the workflow processing.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status: Major Refactor in Progress

**IMPORTANT**: The core iterative functionality (`run_sequential()`) is currently **not working**. The initial implementation attempted to inject data into running workflows using methods that conflict with ComfyUI's core architecture, leading to validation failures and instability.

This discovery has led to a complete refactoring of the execution engine. This document outlines the new, robust architecture that will be implemented to deliver on the project's ambitious goals.

## üéØ The Vision: True Iteration in ComfyUI

ComfyUI's native Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) model is powerful but limited to a single pass. Discomfort's vision is to overcome this by enabling complex control flows, including:

  - **Iterative Refinement:** Feeding the output of a workflow back into its own input for progressive improvement.
  - **Stateful Chains:** Executing multiple different workflows in sequence, where the results of `Workflow A` become the inputs for `Workflow B`.
  - **Conditional Logic:** Using `IF/THEN/ELSE` branches and `DO/WHILE` loops to create dynamic, intelligent workflows that can make decisions based on their own output.
  - **Type-Agnostic Data Flow:** Passing any data type‚Äî`IMAGE`, `MODEL`, `LATENT`, `CONDITIONING`, or any custom type‚Äîbetween iterations seamlessly.

## üí° The Solution: Pre-Execution Graph Manipulation

Instead of fighting ComfyUI's architecture, the new solution embraces it. For each iteration of a loop, the Discomfort engine will **programmatically construct a new, completely valid workflow prompt** that is self-contained and ready for execution. This eliminates the validation and race condition issues of the previous approach.

This is achieved with two key components:

### 1\. The `DiscomfortLoopExecutor` Orchestrator

This will be the main user-facing node. It will manage the entire loop's state and logic, deciding whether to continue, break, or branch based on user-defined conditions. (More information on the vision for its functionalities are available in the documentation: discomfort_doc_DiscomfortLoopExecutor_high_level_logic.md.)

### 2\. The Hybrid Data Store & Universal Loader

To pass data between iterations efficiently and reliably, Discomfort uses a hybrid strategy:

  - **üöÄ In-Memory (Default):** For maximum speed, data objects are passed between iterations as direct Python references via a controlled in-memory store.
  - **üíæ On-Disk (Fallback):** To prevent out-of-memory errors, very large objects (like model tensors) are automatically serialized to temporary files on disk.

An internal `DiscomfortDataLoader` node, which is invisible to the user, is then programmatically inserted into the workflow. This universal loader is configured to fetch the correct data from either memory or disk, ensuring the workflow is valid and has access to the required inputs before it even begins execution.

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works: An Iteration in Detail

1.  **Orchestration Begins:** The `DiscomfortLoopExecutor` node starts an iteration. It holds the current state of all loop variables (e.g., images, text, numbers) in a `loop_state` dictionary.
2.  **Data Preparation:** The orchestrator examines the data in `loop_state`. Based on size and user settings, it either places the data object into the in-memory `_DATA_STORE` or saves it to a temporary file on disk.
3.  **Graph Manipulation:** The orchestrator takes a fresh copy of the target workflow. It finds the placeholder `DiscomfortPort (INPUT)` nodes and replaces them with the internal `DiscomfortDataLoader` node. This new loader is pre-configured with the key or file path to the data for this iteration.
4.  **Validation & Execution:** The modified workflow is now a standard, valid ComfyUI prompt. It is sent to the ComfyUI server, which validates and executes it without any special handling.
5.  **Output Extraction:** Once the workflow finishes, the orchestrator inspects the execution history and extracts the data from any `DiscomfortPort (OUTPUT)` nodes.
6.  **Loop & Condition Check:** The extracted data is used to update the `loop_state` dictionary. The orchestrator then evaluates the user-defined loop conditions to decide whether to start the next iteration, take a branch, or end the loop.

This cycle ensures every single execution is robust, efficient, and fully compliant with ComfyUI's architecture.

## üìñ Usage (Post-Refactor)

Once the refactor is complete, using Discomfort will be straightforward. You will use the `DiscomfortLoopExecutor` node to control your iterative workflows.

**Example: An Iterative Upscaling Workflow**

1.  **Create Workflows:**
      * `init.json`: A simple workflow with a `LoadImage` node connected to a `DiscomfortPort (OUTPUT)` with `unique_id` set to `current_image`.
      * `upscale_step.json`: A workflow that takes an image from a `DiscomfortPort (INPUT)` (`unique_id`: `current_image`), runs it through an upscaler, and outputs it to another `DiscomfortPort (OUTPUT)` (`unique_id`: `current_image`).
2.  **Configure the Loop:**
      * Add a `DiscomfortLoopExecutor` node to your graph.
      * Set **`workflow_paths`** to:
        ```
        init.json
        upscale_step.json
        ```
      * Set **`max_iterations`** to `3`.
      * Set **`loop_condition_expression`** to `discomfort_loop_counter <= max_iterations`. This will run the `upscale_step.json` workflow three times.

When you run this, Discomfort will execute `init.json` once, then loop through `upscale_step.json` three times, passing the upscaled image from each run back into the start of the next.

## üß™ Testing

The test scripts (`test_discomfort.py` and `test_simple.py`) will be updated to validate the fully functional `DiscomfortLoopExecutor` and its underlying `run_workflows` engine. The tests will cover:

  - Multi-iteration execution with state preservation.
  - Correct handling of both in-memory and on-disk data.
  - Conditional branching and loop termination.
  - Type-agnostic data passing.
