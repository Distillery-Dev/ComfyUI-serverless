# Discomfort Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The major refactoring of Discomfort's `run_sequential` method has been completed. The new approach embraces ComfyUI's architecture by manipulating workflow graphs BEFORE execution rather than attempting to inject data during execution.

## Key Changes

### 1. **New Internal Node: DiscomfortDataLoader**

A new internal node `DiscomfortDataLoader` has been created to handle data loading from either memory or disk storage. This node is programmatically inserted into workflows to replace DiscomfortPort INPUT nodes.

**Key features:**
- Loads data from memory (`_DISCOMFORT_DATA_STORE`) or disk
- Returns appropriate defaults if data is not found
- Fully compatible with ComfyUI's validation system

### 2. **Pre-Execution Graph Manipulation**

The core change is in `run_sequential`:

```python
# OLD APPROACH (broken):
# 1. Store data in global variable
# 2. Inject placeholders into prompt
# 3. Hope DiscomfortPort can access data during execution

# NEW APPROACH (working):
# 1. Store data in controlled memory/disk storage
# 2. Replace DiscomfortPort INPUT nodes with DiscomfortDataLoader nodes
# 3. Configure loaders with storage keys
# 4. Execute modified workflow normally
```

### 3. **Simplified DiscomfortPort**

DiscomfortPort has been simplified:
- No longer tries to access global execution data
- Simply passes through input data
- Returns safe defaults when no input is provided
- Works as INPUT, OUTPUT, or PASSTHRU based on connections

### 4. **Robust Data Storage**

Two storage strategies:
- **Memory (default)**: Fast, uses `_DISCOMFORT_DATA_STORE` dictionary
- **Disk (fallback)**: For large data or when `use_ram=False`

## How It Works

### Iteration Flow:

1. **Data Preparation**: Store input data in memory/disk with unique keys
2. **Graph Manipulation**: Replace DiscomfortPort INPUT nodes with DiscomfortDataLoader nodes configured with storage keys
3. **Validation**: The modified workflow passes ComfyUI validation because it contains real nodes with real data
4. **Execution**: ComfyUI executes the workflow normally
5. **Output Extraction**: Collect outputs from DiscomfortPort OUTPUT nodes
6. **Cleanup**: Clear temporary data from storage

### Example Workflow Transformation:

**Original workflow:**
```
[DiscomfortPort "input1"] -> [ProcessingNode] -> [DiscomfortPort "output1"]
```

**Modified workflow (before execution):**
```
[DiscomfortDataLoader key="input1_abc123"] -> [ProcessingNode] -> [DiscomfortPort "output1"]
```

## Usage

### Basic Example:

```python
from custom_nodes.discomfort.workflow_tools import DiscomfortWorkflowTools

tools = DiscomfortWorkflowTools()

# Define inputs
inputs = {
    "image_input": your_image_tensor,
    "text_input": "Hello, Discomfort!"
}

# Run workflows sequentially
result = await tools.run_sequential(
    workflow_paths=["workflow1.json", "workflow2.json"],
    inputs=inputs,
    iterations=3,
    use_ram=True  # Use memory storage (faster)
)

# Access outputs
final_image = result["processed_image"]
```

### With DiscomfortLoopExecutor:

```python
# In ComfyUI, add a DiscomfortLoopExecutor node and configure:
- workflow_paths: path/to/workflow1.json
                  path/to/workflow2.json
- max_iterations: 5
- initial_inputs: image_port: [1, 512, 512, 3]
                  quality: 0.8
- loop_condition_expression: discomfort_loop_counter <= max_iterations
```

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Works within ComfyUI's validation and execution model
2. **Type Safety**: Proper type handling through the entire pipeline
3. **Performance**: Efficient data passing via references when possible
4. **Flexibility**: Supports any ComfyUI data type without hardcoding
5. **Debugging**: Clear separation of concerns makes issues easier to trace

## Migration Guide

If you have existing Discomfort workflows:

1. **No changes needed** to workflow JSON files
2. **Update the extension** to get the new implementation
3. **DiscomfortPort nodes** work the same from a user perspective
4. **Performance** should be better with the new approach

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the installation:

```bash
cd ComfyUI
python -m custom_nodes.discomfort.test_refactored
```

Expected output:
```
âœ… SUCCESS: Output matches expected inverted image!
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "DiscomfortDataLoader not found"
**Solution**: Restart ComfyUI to ensure the new node is registered

### Issue: "No data found in memory store"
**Solution**: Check that workflow paths are correct and DiscomfortPort unique_ids match

### Issue: "Validation failed"
**Solution**: Ensure all nodes in your workflow are properly connected and have valid inputs

## Future Improvements

1. **Batch Processing**: Optimize for processing multiple items in parallel
2. **Distributed Execution**: Support for multi-machine setups
3. **Caching**: Smart caching of intermediate results
4. **Visual Debugging**: UI tools to visualize data flow between iterations
