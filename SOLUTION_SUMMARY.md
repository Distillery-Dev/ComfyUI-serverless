# Discomfort run_sequential Solution Summary

## Problem Statement
The `run_sequential` method was failing because ComfyUI's validation expected actual data objects (tensors, etc.) but our placeholder approach was passing dictionary structures that didn't match ComfyUI's type expectations.

## Solution Overview
We implemented a two-phase approach:

### 1. Validation Phase
- Create valid dummy data that matches expected types (e.g., small tensors for IMAGE type)
- Inject this valid data into the prompt so ComfyUI's validation passes
- Store the real data in a global `_temp_execution_data` dictionary

### 2. Execution Phase  
- DiscomfortPort nodes check `_temp_execution_data` for injected data matching their unique_id
- If found, use the real injected data
- If not found, use the data passed through normal ComfyUI links

## Key Changes Made

### workflow_tools.py
1. **create_valid_data_for_type()**: New method that creates minimal valid objects for each ComfyUI type:
   - IMAGE: Small tensor with shape [1, 64, 64, 3]
   - LATENT: Dict with 'samples' key containing small tensor
   - MODEL/CLIP/VAE: Minimal objects with expected attributes
   - INT/FLOAT/STRING/BOOLEAN: Simple default values

2. **run_sequential()**: Simplified injection approach:
   - Store real data in `_temp_execution_data[execution_id]["injected_data"][uid]`
   - Inject valid dummy data into prompt for validation
   - Clean up execution data after workflow completes

### nodes.py
1. **DiscomfortPort.process_port()**: Simplified to check for injected data:
   - Look through all execution contexts for data matching the port's unique_id
   - If found, use the real injected data
   - Otherwise, use the data passed through normal links
   - Added debug logging to track data flow

## How It Works

1. **Workflow Loading**: Load workflow JSON and discover DiscomfortPort nodes
2. **Data Preparation**: For each input port with data, create both:
   - Real data (stored in `_temp_execution_data`)
   - Valid dummy data (injected into prompt)
3. **Validation**: ComfyUI validates the prompt with dummy data (passes because types match)
4. **Execution**: DiscomfortPort nodes retrieve real data from `_temp_execution_data`
5. **Output Extraction**: Collect outputs from DiscomfortPort OUTPUT nodes
6. **Cleanup**: Remove execution data from `_temp_execution_data`

## Testing

We provide multiple test approaches to verify the functionality:

### Method 1: Module Test (Recommended)
Run as a Python module from ComfyUI root directory:
```bash
# Start ComfyUI server first
python main.py

# In another terminal, from ComfyUI root:
python -m custom_nodes.discomfort.test_discomfort
```

### Method 2: Simple API Test
Uses HTTP API to avoid import complications:
```bash
# With ComfyUI server running:
python custom_nodes/discomfort/test_simple.py
```

### Method 3: Direct UI Testing
1. Start ComfyUI normally
2. Create a workflow with DiscomfortPort nodes
3. Set unique_id for input ports (e.g., "image_in")
4. Set unique_id for output ports (e.g., "image_out")
5. Use DiscomfortTestRunner node to test the workflow

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **General**: Works with any ComfyUI data type without node-specific code
2. **Non-invasive**: Doesn't modify ComfyUI internals or require monkey-patching
3. **Reliable**: Uses ComfyUI's native validation and execution flow
4. **Debuggable**: Clear logging shows data flow at each step

## Limitations

1. Requires ComfyUI server to be running (not standalone)
2. Global state in `_temp_execution_data` (cleaned up after use)
3. Dummy data creation adds minimal overhead

## Next Steps

1. Test with actual complex workflows (FLUX, SUPIR)
2. Implement full DiscomfortLoopExecutor logic
3. Add more robust error handling and recovery
4. Consider caching dummy objects for performance
